Hi! Thanks so much for wanting to make a code contribution. Given the immense maintenance scope of a project this big, I try to avoid pull requests. This app's source will remain available so long as it continues to exist and I am more than excited to discuss the prospect of new features and ramifications of bugs extensively in issues so that I may gain the context on the use case and we may deliberate on the best solution forward. Feel free to ignore this template if we've discussed prior to opening. Thank you for your understanding. <3
